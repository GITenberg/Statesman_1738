description: 'The Statesman is Plato''s neglected political work, but it is crucial
  for an understanding of the development of his political thinking. In some respects
  it continues themes from the Republic, particularly the importance of knowledge
  as entitlement to rule. But there are also changes: Plato has dropped the ambitious
  metaphysical synthesis of the Republic, changed his view of the moral psychology
  of the citizen, and revised his position on the role of law and institutions. In
  its presentation of the statesman''s expertise, the Statesman modifies, as well
  as defending in original ways, this central theme of the Republic.'
